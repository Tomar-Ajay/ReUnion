Hi,

I have created 3 routes,
-auth contains: register, login API's
-posts contains: create a post, update a post by id, delete a post by id, like and unlike, comment, get a post by id, get all the related post API's
-users contains: update by id, delete by id, get by id, follow, and unfollow API's

npm i //for packages
set up the db
npm start //for starting the server
